# EY-s-Product-Management-Hackathon-2022

Inspiration
Inspired by the employees in the exploratory phase of their careers, we present EY UniVRsity, a fully immersive space that facilitates the educational and social development of EY's very own talent.

Market User Research
During our research, we identified a disconnect between the senior and junior employees at the firm, where their perception of the Badge varies drastically. With junior partners more invested in the program, they often seek to explore and validate their own skills through the program, believing that these certifications will equip them with a competitive advantage in their careers.

Product Vision
EY UniVRsity was created to revamp EY's internal learning and development program. We hope to create a space where the EY Badge is universally recognized, the course content is universally transferable, and the learners can connect with both the material and their peers practically. EY UniVRsity makes growth and development accessible, integrating it into a learner's lifestyle seamlessly.

Solution
Develop skills. Apply Skills. Build relationships. Be recognized. EY UniVRsity redefines what it means to learn and our relationship to acquiring new skills. Founded upon Decentraland, UniVRsity offers EY employees both access to curated VR-based interactive learning content and a community of interconnected learners all supporting each other and motivating each other. After completion of a course, the student is then able to acquire an NFT badge that enables transferability and recognizability throughout the industry. They are then placed on a leaderboard for skill-based VR challenges and can serve as additional motivation for new learners to that skill.

Key Product Features
Access interactive VR learning modules to enhance learning
Meet and interact virtually with the EY team globally, un-siloing your work
Nurture relationships between EY employees across campuses
Acquire standardized NFTs to trustlessly verify developed skills
Engage in competitions for skill-based VR learning challenges and climb global EY leaderboards
Desired Customer Outcome
EY UniVRsity helps learners expand their domains of expertise, achieve their professional goals, and connect the global EY network through a socially enriching space. But more importantly, EY UniVRsity provides the opportunity for learners to apply their newly acquired skills in a dynamic and impactful way, allowing learners to feel intrinsically fulfilled.

What's next for EY UniVRsity
We see EY UniVRsity pushing the boundaries of virtual education by introducing tokenized certifications and leveraging digital spaces. We hope to invite other companies into our space, an ever-growing virtual learning hub for the world to connect, grow, and achieve their dreams.
